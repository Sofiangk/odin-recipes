    <p>Take classic Mediterranean flavors and make American-style comfort food for your family! If you are looking for a meatless meal, serve this with a salad and crusty bread. If your family prefers a protein, a rotisserie chicken or a slice of ham would be an easy and tasty addition to the lovely flavors of this casserole.</p>
